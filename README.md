* This application is a library management system
* The system requires an active user in order to interact with borrowing and returning.
* In user operations, the user can add a new user, view user details and also display all users.
* When adding a user the user will be prompted for a name and a library ID.
* Under view user details, the user will not only be able to see a list of users, but will also be able to assign the current active user.
* When the user chooses to display all users, they will see, not only a list of usernames, but also a list of any borrowed books
* Under book operations, the user has several options. The option to add a book, borrow a book, return a book, search for a book using the book title, display all books with relevant details, display all authors with relevant details, and return to main menu.
* When borrowing a book, the books availability will be turned to borrowed. The program then does not allow any other users to borrow the same book. Once the book has been returned, the availability changes to available, and the book becomes available for borrowing to all other users.
